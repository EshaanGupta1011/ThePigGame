# ThePigGame
This is my second project learning the basics of JavaScript where i have created a multiplayer game. The objective of the player is to reach a score of 100 without getting a '1' on the die. The player can hold the score whenever he/she feels like. If the player gets a '1', the second player will get a chance to roll the die. First to 100 points win.
